# Vasicek Model Calibration: GMM vs MLE  

This project focuses on calibrating the Vasicek interest rate model using two statistical methods: **Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)** and **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**. The aim is to compare the effectiveness and accuracy of these techniques in estimating the model's parameters.  

### Key Features  
- Implementation of the Vasicek model, a mean-reverting stochastic process for interest rates.  
- Calibration using:  
  - **GMM**: Leveraging moment conditions to estimate parameters.  
  - **MLE**: Maximizing the likelihood function to fit the model.  
- Comparative analysis of parameter estimates and model performance.  
- Visualization of calibration results and interest rate simulations.  

### Technologies  
- **Python** for numerical computations and modeling.  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels`.
